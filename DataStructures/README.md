> 
> It explores the disavantages and benefits of using certain data structures: vector, double linked list, single linked list, binary search tree, hash table. 

__*Math Vector*__
> A data structure I created when I was in Math 270B which introduced me to mathematical vectors.
> 
> Vector2d is a template struct that will create a 2d vector and you can do basic vector math with scalars, dot products, and more.
> It is very simple and not complete but with it I was able do the beginning of a physics engine with have different forces interact.
